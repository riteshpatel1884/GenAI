## 📖 Overview

This repository is a personal knowledge base and playground for exploring **Generative AI** concepts step by step — starting from the fundamentals of chat and embedding models, moving through prompt engineering and structured outputs, and culminating in full **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines backed by vector databases.

Each folder is self-contained, with working code examples and templates that build on one another.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or `pip`

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riteshpatel1884/GenAI.git
cd GenAI
```

**Using `uv` (recommended):**
```bash
uv sync
```

**Using `pip`:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys as needed:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

## 🧭 Suggested Learning Path

```
01_chat_models  →  02_embedding_models  →  03_local_models
       ↓
04_chatBot  →  05_prompt_templets  →  06_structured_outputs
       ↓
07_RAG  →  08_vector_DB  →  10_runnables  →  09_Project
```

Start with the fundamentals of chat and embedding models, then move into prompting and structured outputs, and finally combine everything into RAG pipelines and complete projects.
